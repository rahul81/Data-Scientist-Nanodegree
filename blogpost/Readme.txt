You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


### Project Motivation

As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project Term 2 project to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM. I was intriguted to analyze and find business related questions about airbnb listings for Seattle city. This interest stem from being a frequent user of airbnb and a curious traveler that is  interested in knowning the trends in prices and what can affect.

### summary of the project

In this notebook I wanted to analyze the Seattle airbnb listings. I used descriptive statistics and data modelling techniques such as Kmean clustering and xgboost to answer the following questions:


1) What are some most expensive property type in Seattle City?

I first had a look at the distribution of property type across the city then grouped the data by property to get the average price for each type of property.

2) Effect on booking prices at different times of the year?

After looking at the average monthly price of listings across the year, I compared the listings prices with the availability of listings and got inverse relationship between these two, Cheapest time to visit Seattle is during the start of the year to March.  

3) Most expansive and least expansive Neighbourhood in Seattle?
- Most Expensive neighourhood is Fair-mount park followed by Industrial District, Portage Bay ranging between $150 to $350.

- Least Expensive ones are Roxhill, Olympic Hills ranging from $50 to $100 showing a huge difference compared to expensive ones. 
 

4) What are the attributes associated with the price of a listing?

    - Availability
    - Neighbourhood
    - Property Type
    - Room TypeÂ 
    - Cancellation Policy
    - No. of Reviews
